**What is QA (Quality Assurance)?**  
- A process-focused activity that ensures software development follows the correct standards, methods, and procedures.  
- The goal is to prevent defects before they happen by improving processes.  
- Focuses on **how** the product is made, not just on testing the final product.

**Difference between QA and Tester**  

**QA (Quality Assurance)**  
- Process-oriented → focuses on *how* the software is developed.  
- Prevents defects by improving processes and following standards.  
- Works throughout the development cycle.  
- Goal: **Prevent problems before they happen**.

**Tester**  
- Product-oriented → focuses on *what* the software does.  
- Finds defects by executing tests on the product.  
- Works mainly during and after development phases.  
- Goal: **Find problems after they happen**.


**What and why we do software testing?**  
- Software testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches the expected requirements and to ensure the product is free from defects.

**The purpose of software testing?**  
- To identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements by comparing the product against the expected requirements.

**What is another way to define software testing?**  
- Some define it as White Box Testing and Black Box Testing.

**What is White Box Testing?**  
- Testing the internal structure, design, and code of the software.  
- The tester knows how the system works internally.  
*Memory tip*: **White** = like shining a light *inside* the box.

**What is Black Box Testing?**  
- Testing the software’s functionality without looking at its internal code or structure.  
- The tester focuses only on inputs and outputs.  
*Memory tip*: **Black** = can’t see inside, only check what comes in and out.

**Why is software testing important?**  
- Finds bugs or errors early so they can be fixed before the software is delivered.  
- Ensures the product is reliable, secure, and performs well.  
- Saves time, reduces costs, and increases customer satisfaction.

**What are the benefits of software testing?**  
- **Cost-effective** → Catching bugs early is cheaper to fix, saving money in the long run.  
- **Security** → Removes risks and problems early, giving users a trusted product.  
- **Product quality** → Ensures the delivered software meets quality standards.  
- **Customer satisfaction** → Good UI/UX testing provides the best user experience.

**What is the difference between software testing and software testing in engineering?**  

**Software testing**  
- The process of checking if software works as expected.  
- Focused only on finding bugs, ensuring quality, and verifying requirements.

**Software testing in engineering**  
- Part of the software engineering process (within the Software Development Life Cycle).  
- Planned, documented, and integrated with other phases like design, development, and maintenance.  
- Follows standards, uses metrics, and works alongside quality assurance.  
- Involves evaluating if the software meets required conditions.  
- Checks for missing requirements, bugs or errors, and ensures security, reliability, and performance.

**Memory tip:**  
- **Software testing** → Just the act of testing.  
- **Software testing in engineering** → Testing as part of a bigger, structured process with extra checks for security, reliability, and performance.


> Note: There are over 150 testing types, but not all apply to every project. The choice depends on the project’s nature and scope.

**Types of Software Testing**  
Testing is usually classified into three main categories:  

1. **Functional Testing**  
   - Unit Testing  
   - Integration Testing  
   - Smoke Testing  
   - UAT (User Acceptance Testing)  

2. **Non-Functional Testing** (Performance Testing)  
   - Performance Testing  
   - Endurance Testing  
   - Load Testing  
   - Volume Testing  

3. **Maintenance Testing**  
   - Regression Testing  
   - Maintenance Testing  


**Testing Strategies in Software Engineering**  

- **Unit Testing** → Tests individual units of code to ensure they work correctly.  
- **Integration Testing** → Checks if combined units work together without errors.  
- **System Testing** → Tests the entire system as a whole, including functionality, security, and portability.  
- **Validation Testing** → Confirms the software meets the intended business needs.

**Program Testing**  
- Involves running the actual software program with test data to check behavior and find errors.  
- Good program testing has a high chance of finding bugs.

**Summary of Software Testing Basics**  
- **Definition**: An activity to check if actual results match expected results and to ensure the system is free from defects.  
- **Importance**: Bugs can be expensive or dangerous.  
- **Reasons**: Cost-effective, improves security, ensures product quality, increases customer satisfaction.  
- **Main Categories**: Functional, Non-Functional (Performance), Maintenance.  
- **Key Strategies**: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Validation Testing, System Testing.
